# Cherenkov-Gamma-Telescope-ML
Machine learning analysis for Cherenkov gamma telescope data. Simulated with Corsika, the dataset emulates high-energy gamma particle registrations. Goal: Discriminate primary gamma signals from cosmic ray background using image processing and Hillas parameters. Explore astrophysics with ML!
